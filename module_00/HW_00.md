# HW_00 - Generative AI writing analysis

In this assignment, you will generate instructions on brushing your teeth. You can use [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)

Some metrics to add to the generated instructions:

- number of strokes per minute
- total brushing time
- time spent per tooth 
- number of teeth or total area to brush on teeth
- deflection of brush bristles for proper cleaning
- what else can you think of?

## Prompt Input and Output

-> _copy-paste your prompts and outputs here_

Prompt:
Can you help me create instructions on how to brush my teeth? I'm looking for instruction on number of strokes per minute, total brushing time, time spent per tooth, number of teeth or total area to brush on teeth, deflection of brush bristles for proper cleaning, and rinsing technique.

Output:
Certainly! Here's a detailed guide on how to brush your teeth effectively:

Brushing Instructions
Preparation

Wet Your Toothbrush: Start by wetting your toothbrush with water to soften the bristles.
Apply Toothpaste: Squeeze a pea-sized amount of fluoride toothpaste onto the bristles.
Brushing Technique

Angle and Positioning: Hold the toothbrush at a 45-degree angle to your gums.
Strokes per Minute: Aim for 300-400 gentle strokes per minute. This translates to a moderate, controlled pace.
Total Brushing Time

Duration: Brush your teeth for a total of 2 minutes. You can use a timer or an electric toothbrush with a built-in timer for accuracy.
Time Spent per Tooth

Focus Areas: Divide your mouth into four quadrants (upper right, upper left, lower right, lower left). Spend 30 seconds on each quadrant.
Individual Teeth: Focus on each tooth, spending approximately 2-3 seconds per tooth, including the front, back, and chewing surfaces.
Total Area to Brush

Number of Teeth: An adult typically has 28 teeth (excluding wisdom teeth). Ensure you brush all surfaces of each tooth.
Surfaces: Brush the outer surfaces, inner surfaces, and chewing surfaces of all your teeth. Don't forget the back molars.
Deflection of Brush Bristles

Pressure: Apply gentle pressure so that the bristles bend slightly. Over-pressing can cause gum damage and ineffective cleaning.
Brushing Motion

Small Circular Motions: Use small circular motions, especially along the gum line, to effectively remove plaque and food particles.
Sweeping Strokes: On the chewing surfaces, use short back-and-forth strokes.
Rinsing Technique

Rinse Mouth: After brushing, thoroughly rinse your mouth with water to remove any remaining toothpaste and debris.
Rinse Toothbrush: Rinse your toothbrush under running water to clean off any toothpaste and debris. Store it upright to air dry.
Additional Tips
Replace Toothbrush: Replace your toothbrush every 3-4 months, or sooner if the bristles are frayed.
Use Mouthwash: Consider using an antimicrobial mouthwash after brushing for additional oral hygiene benefits.
Floss Daily: Floss once a day to remove plaque and food particles between teeth where a toothbrush can't reach.
By following these instructions, you can maintain good oral hygiene and ensure your teeth are clean and healthy.

## Revised document

-> _copy-paste the document here, then edit the output to remove passive phrasing and add specific ideas from your own research or experience (try quantifying any phrases such as 'many', 'fewer', 'more important', etc._


Brushing Instructions

Preparation

Start by wetting your toothbrush with water to soften the bristles. Squeeze a pea-sized amount of dentist approved fluoride toothpaste onto the bristles.



Brushing Technique

Hold the toothbrush so the bristles are perpendicular to the outside, top, and inside of your tooth while you clean each respectivly. Aim for a speed of 300-400 gentle strokes per minute. This translates to a moderate, controlled pace. Brush the outer surfaces, inner surfaces, and chewing surfaces of all your teeth. Don't forget the back molars.



Total Brushing Time

Brush your teeth for a total of 2 minutes. You can use a timer or an electric toothbrush with a built-in timer for accuracy.



Time Spent per Tooth

Divide your mouth into four quadrants (upper right, upper left, lower right, lower left). Spend 30 seconds on each quadrant. Focus on each tooth, spending approximately 2-3 seconds per tooth, including the front, back, and chewing surfaces.



Deflection of Brush Bristles

Apply gentle pressure so that the bristles bend slightly and allow the toothbrush to "sink" 2-3mm. Over-pressing can cause gum damage and ineffective cleaning.



Brushing Motion

Use small circular motions, especially along the gum line, to effectively remove plaque and food particles. On the chewing surfaces, use short back-and-forth strokes.



Rinsing Technique

After brushing, thoroughly rinse your mouth with water to remove any remaining toothpaste and debris. After rinsing, make sure you spit the water out. Rinse your toothbrush under running water to clean off any toothpaste and debris. Store it upright to air dry.

- Make a list of all the improvements and changes you made to document
- use the `tf_idf.cosineSimilarity` function to compare the AI version to your own

Write a report on your intellectual property  in the 'revised document'. 
- How much can you claim as yours?
- How many ideas came from AI?
- How many ideas came from you?
- Is this a _new_ document?
- If this work was made by you and another person-not AI-would you need to credit this person as a coauthor?
- What else can you discuss about this comparison and this process?


1) removed "Certainly! Here's a detailed guide on how to brush your teeth effectively:"

2) removed subheadings

3) changed the angle and positioning section

4) Revised the rinsing technique

5) Removed addtional tips

My intellectual property report:


The revised document on brushing instructions is a collaborative effort between myself and an AI assistant. While the AI provided structured guidance, the document is primarily my intellectual property due to my synthesis, revisions, and final integration. However, there is a great deal of credit that needs to be given to the AI as most of the quantifications were created by the AI and not by me doing my own research. Technically, the AI contributed ideas on preparation steps, brushing technique, total brushing time, time spent per tooth, deflection of brush bristles, brushing motion, and rinsing technique. These contributions are not subject to copyright, allowing me to claim ownership of the integrated content.

My contributions include the final synthesis and wording, specific phrasing adjustments, and contextual additions, such as emphasizing "dentist approved fluoride toothpaste." This makes the revised document a new piece of work that combines my original input with the AI's structured guidance. However, had this document been created with another person, I would have needed to credit them as a co-author. In this case, the AI's role as a guide does not require such attribution, allowing me to claim sole authorship.

Using AI tools introduces a new dimension to the creative process, where AI provides structured information and suggestions. However, integrating AI-generated content required my critical thinking and creativity to ensure the document met its intended purpose and quality standards.

The revised document on brushing instructions reflects a successful integration of AI-generated ideas and my intellectual contributions. The final document is my intellectual property, highlighting the evolving nature of collaborative work with AI and emphasizing the importance of personal contribution in creating new and original content.
