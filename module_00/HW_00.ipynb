    "\n",
    "Angle and Positioning: Hold the toothbrush at a 45-degree angle to your gums.\n",
    "Strokes per Minute: Aim for 300-400 gentle strokes per minute. This translates to a moderate, controlled pace.\n",
    "Total Brushing Time\n",

       "0  Certainly! Here's a detailed guide on how to brush your teeth effectively:\\n\\nBrushing Instructions Preparation\\n\\nWet Your Toothbrush: Start by wetting your toothbrush with water to soften the bristles. Apply Toothpaste: Squeeze a pea-sized amount of fluoride toothpaste onto the bristles. Brushing Technique\\n\\nAngle and Positioning: Hold the toothbrush at a 45-degree angle to your gums. Strokes per Minute: Aim for 300-400 gentle strokes per minute. This translates to a moderate, controlled pace. Total Brushing Time\\n\\nDuration: Brush your teeth for a total of 2 minutes. You can use a timer or an electric toothbrush with a built-in timer for accuracy. Time Spent per Tooth\\n\\nFocus Areas: Divide your mouth into four quadrants (upper right, upper left, lower right, lower left). Spend 30 seconds on each quadrant. Individual Teeth: Focus on each tooth, spending approximately 2-3 seconds per tooth, including the front, back, and chewing surfaces. Total Area to Brush\\n\\nNumber of Teeth: An adult typically has 28 teeth (excluding wisdom teeth). Ensure you brush all surfaces of each tooth. Surfaces: Brush the outer surfaces, inner surfaces, and chewing surfaces of all your teeth. Don't forget the back molars. Deflection of Brush Bristles\\n\\nPressure: Apply gentle pressure so that the bristles bend slightly. Over-pressing can cause gum damage and ineffective cleaning. Brushing Motion\\n\\nSmall Circular Motions: Use small circular motions, especially along the gum line, to effectively remove plaque and food particles. Sweeping Strokes: On the chewing surfaces, use short back-and-forth strokes. Rinsing Technique\\n\\nRinse Mouth: After brushing, thoroughly rinse your mouth with water to remove any remaining toothpaste and debris. Rinse Toothbrush: Rinse your toothbrush under running water to clean off any toothpaste and debris. Store it upright to air dry. Additional Tips Replace Toothbrush: Replace your toothbrush every 3-4 months, or sooner if the bristles are frayed. Use Mouthwash: Consider using an antimicrobial mouthwash after brushing for additional oral hygiene benefits. Floss Daily: Floss once a day to remove plaque and food particles between teeth where a toothbrush can't reach. By following these instructions, you can maintain good oral hygiene and ensure your teeth are clean and healthy.   \n",

       "      <td>Certainly! Here's a detailed guide on how to brush your teeth effectively:\\n\\nBrushing Instructions Preparation\\n\\nWet Your Toothbrush: Start by wetting your toothbrush with water to soften the bristles. Apply Toothpaste: Squeeze a pea-sized amount of fluoride toothpaste onto the bristles. Brushing Technique\\n\\nAngle and Positioning: Hold the toothbrush at a 45-degree angle to your gums. Strokes per Minute: Aim for 300-400 gentle strokes per minute. This translates to a moderate, controlled pace. Total Brushing Time\\n\\nDuration: Brush your teeth for a total of 2 minutes. You can use a timer or an electric toothbrush with a built-in timer for accuracy. Time Spent per Tooth\\n\\nFocus Areas: Divide your mouth into four quadrants (upper right, upper left, lower right, lower left). Spend 30 seconds on each quadrant. Individual Teeth: Focus on each tooth, spending approximately 2-3 seconds per tooth, including the front, back, and chewing surfaces. Total Area to Brush\\n\\nNumber of Teeth: An adult typically has 28 teeth (excluding wisdom teeth). Ensure you brush all surfaces of each tooth. Surfaces: Brush the outer surfaces, inner surfaces, and chewing surfaces of all your teeth. Don't forget the back molars. Deflection of Brush Bristles\\n\\nPressure: Apply gentle pressure so that the bristles bend slightly. Over-pressing can cause gum damage and ineffective cleaning. Brushing Motion\\n\\nSmall Circular Motions: Use small circular motions, especially along the gum line, to effectively remove plaque and food particles. Sweeping Strokes: On the chewing surfaces, use short back-and-forth strokes. Rinsing Technique\\n\\nRinse Mouth: After brushing, thoroughly rinse your mouth with water to remove any remaining toothpaste and debris. Rinse Toothbrush: Rinse your toothbrush under running water to clean off any toothpaste and debris. Store it upright to air dry. Additional Tips Replace Toothbrush: Replace your toothbrush every 3-4 months, or sooner if the bristles are frayed. Use Mouthwash: Consider using an antimicrobial mouthwash after brushing for additional oral hygiene benefits. Floss Daily: Floss once a day to remove plaque and food particles between teeth where a toothbrush can't reach. By following these instructions, you can maintain good oral hygiene and ensure your teeth are clean and healthy.</td>\n",

       "0  Certainly! Here's a detailed guide on how to brush your teeth effectively:\\n\\nBrushing Instructions Preparation\\n\\nWet Your Toothbrush: Start by wetting your toothbrush with water to soften the bristles. Apply Toothpaste: Squeeze a pea-sized amount of fluoride toothpaste onto the bristles. Brushing Technique\\n\\nAngle and Positioning: Hold the toothbrush at a 45-degree angle to your gums. Strokes per Minute: Aim for 300-400 gentle strokes per minute. This translates to a moderate, controlled pace. Total Brushing Time\\n\\nDuration: Brush your teeth for a total of 2 minutes. You can use a timer or an electric toothbrush with a built-in timer for accuracy. Time Spent per Tooth\\n\\nFocus Areas: Divide your mouth into four quadrants (upper right, upper left, lower right, lower left). Spend 30 seconds on each quadrant. Individual Teeth: Focus on each tooth, spending approximately 2-3 seconds per tooth, including the front, back, and chewing surfaces. Total Area to Brush\\n\\nNumber of Teeth: An adult typically has 28 teeth (excluding wisdom teeth). Ensure you brush all surfaces of each tooth. Surfaces: Brush the outer surfaces, inner surfaces, and chewing surfaces of all your teeth. Don't forget the back molars. Deflection of Brush Bristles\\n\\nPressure: Apply gentle pressure so that the bristles bend slightly. Over-pressing can cause gum damage and ineffective cleaning. Brushing Motion\\n\\nSmall Circular Motions: Use small circular motions, especially along the gum line, to effectively remove plaque and food particles. Sweeping Strokes: On the chewing surfaces, use short back-and-forth strokes. Rinsing Technique\\n\\nRinse Mouth: After brushing, thoroughly rinse your mouth with water to remove any remaining toothpaste and debris. Rinse Toothbrush: Rinse your toothbrush under running water to clean off any toothpaste and debris. Store it upright to air dry. Additional Tips Replace Toothbrush: Replace your toothbrush every 3-4 months, or sooner if the bristles are frayed. Use Mouthwash: Consider using an antimicrobial mouthwash after brushing for additional oral hygiene benefits. Floss Daily: Floss once a day to remove plaque and food particles between teeth where a toothbrush can't reach. By following these instructions, you can maintain good oral hygiene and ensure your teeth are clean and healthy.   \n",

Squeeze a pea-sized amount of dentist approved fluoride toothpaste onto the bristles.\\n\\nBrushing Technique Hold the toothbrush so the bristles are perpendicular to the outside, top, and inside of your tooth while you clean each respectivly. Aim for a speed of 300-400 gentle strokes per minute. This translates to a moderate, controlled pace. Brush the outer surfaces, inner surfaces, and chewing surfaces of all your teeth. Don't forget the back molars.\\n\\nTotal Brushing Time Brush your teeth for a total of 2 minutes. You can use a timer or an electric toothbrush with a built-in timer for accuracy.\\n\\nTime Spent per Tooth Divide your mouth into four quadrants (upper right, upper left, lower right, lower left). Spend 30 seconds on each quadrant. Focus on each tooth, spending approximately 2-3 seconds per tooth, including the front, back, and chewing surfaces.\\n\\nDeflection of Brush Bristles Apply gentle pressure so that the bristles bend slightly and allow the toothbrush to \"sink\" 2-3mm. Over-pressing can cause gum damage and ineffective cleaning.\\n\\nBrushing Motion Use small circular motions, especially along the gum line, to effectively remove plaque and food particles. On the chewing surfaces, use short back-and-forth strokes.\\n\\nRinsing Technique After brushing, thoroughly rinse your mouth with water to remove any remaining toothpaste and debris. After rinsing, make sure you spit the water out. Rinse your toothbrush under running water to clean off any toothpaste and debris. Store it upright to air dry.   \n",
